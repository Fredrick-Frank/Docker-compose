# Docker-compose:
Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you can define a complex application with multiple services, networks, and volumes in a single YAML file (docker-compose.yml). This simplifies the process of starting, stopping, and managing the different components of your application, as you can control them all with simple commands.
>> Key Concepts:
    Services:
        In Docker Compose, each component of your application is defined as a "service."
        For example, a typical web application might have a web server service, a database service, and a cache service.
    Containers:
        Each service runs in its own container, which is an isolated environment created from a Docker image.
        Docker Compose manages the lifecycle of these containers, including building, starting, stopping, and removing them.
    Networks:
        Docker Compose allows you to define custom networks, enabling containers to communicate with each other securely.
        By default, Docker Compose sets up a network for your services, so they can easily interact using service names as hostnames.
    Volumes:
        Volumes allow you to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.
        Docker Compose allows you to define and manage volumes, making it easy to handle data storage needs for your application.

vim docker-compose.yaml:
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
    networks:
      - mynetwork

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydatabase
      MYSQL_USER: user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - mynetwork
volumes:
  db_data:
networks:
  mynetwork:

>> Breakdown of the Example:
    version: Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format. In this example, it's version 3.
    services:
    web: This service uses the nginx:alpine Docker image, maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the host, and mounts a local directory (./html) to the web server's document root.
    db: This service uses the mysql:5.7 Docker image, sets up environment variables to configure the MySQL database, and mounts a volume (db_data) for persistent storage.
    volumes:
        db_data: A named volume used to persist the MySQL database data.
    networks:
        mynetwork: A custom network that allows the web and db services to communicate with each other.

Basic Docker Compose Commands
* Starting Services:
#docker-compose up ------- This command starts all the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file. You can add the -d flag to run the services in the background (detached mode).
* Stopping Services:
docker-compose down ------------ This command stops and removes all the containers, networks, and volumes created by docker-compose up.
* Viewing Logs:
docker-compose logs --------------- This command shows the logs from all services. You can add -f to follow the logs in real-time.
* Scaling Services:
docker-compose up --scale web=3 ----------- This command scales the web service to run three containers.

>> Benefits of Docker Compose:
    * Simplified Multi-Container Management: Manage all the components of your application with a single docker-compose.yml file.
    * Environment Consistency: Easily recreate your application in different environments (development, staging, production) with the same setup.
    * Isolation and Independence: Services run in isolated containers, ensuring they donâ€™t interfere with each other.
    * Ease of Use: Simplifies the process of starting, stopping, and managing containers with simple commands.

Docker Compose is a powerful tool for managing complex Docker-based applications, especially when they consist of multiple interdependent services.
